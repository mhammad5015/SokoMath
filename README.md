# SokoMath Puzzle Game
SokoMath is a puzzle game where the player needs to push boxes onto designated spots in order to solve each level. This particular version of the game was coded by [Mouhammad Alkhateeb] using various algorithms, including UserPlay, BFS, DFS, UCS, and A*.

## Features
- Multiple levels of increasing difficulty
- Various algorithms to solve the game

## How to Play
The objective of the game is to push all the boxes onto the designated spots. The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) and can only push one box at a time. The game is won when all boxes are on their designated spots.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms were used to solve the game:
- UserPlay: allows the player to solve the game manually using the CMD
- BFS: uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path to the solution
- DFS: uses depth-first search to find a solution
- UCS: uses uniform-cost search to find the cheapest path to the solution
- A*: uses A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the solution

## Installation
To play the game, simply clone the repository and run the main.js file in your node. No additional installation is required.
